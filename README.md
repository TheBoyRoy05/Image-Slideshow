# Image-Slideshow
A Project that allows you to beautifully display images after pulling all relative paths underneath the 'Images' directory thanks to the use of a python script called <code>read_files.py</code>

This will display images in a sequential order that will randomly place them on a normal 1920*1080 webpage that is completly blank.
